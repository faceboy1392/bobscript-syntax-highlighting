# Read me

This is just a basic extension to provide syntax highlighting for `.bob` or `.bobscript` files. BobScript is a language designed for use with [Bob Bot](https://faceboy-dev.herokuapp.com/projects/bob/index.html), a multipurpose Discord bot. BobScript will allow people to create their own custom commands with nice concise syntax. 

## Note

I have never made a VSCode extension before, much less one for syntax highlighting. If you have any suggestions to improve it or any bugs that may need to be fixed, you can join [Bob Bot's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/33Aw6gWmmV) and ping me there. I'd greatly appreciate any suggestions to improve this extension!
